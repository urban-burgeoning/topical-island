<h1>Intro CI/CD with Github Actions</h1>
<h3>Or: being too lazy to copy code to the server.</h3>

<p>This "article" follows <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/github-actions-deploy/">this article</a> and is implemented by
<a href="https://github.com/urban-burgeoning/topical-island/pull/1">the very first pull request on Topical Island.</a>
</p>
(So if all goes well, it will be the first "article" "automatically" "deployed" via this Action.)

<h3>Github Actions</h3>
I mean, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">go here</a> and have them put the sell on you. It's an integrated, free-ish (free for non-commercial users)
set of things, which mostly seem to be focused on integrating with popular providers (AWS, etc.) rather than DIY solutions.
<br>
However! It does have a big stack of community plugins, so we can use those instead.<br>
I used one such Community thing to rsync files across onto the server.


<h3>The Problem</h3>
The issue, as always, is security. The Github Action runs in an ephemeral Docker container without input.<br>
So, we need to be able to access the server via SSH without interaction, so no passwords.<br>
Obviously, if you know anything about computers (and I don't) the answer is easy. If you don't, you need someone to walk you through it. So, let's do that.

<ol>
    <li>SSH onto your server and navigate to ~/.ssh.</li><br>
    <li>Run:<br>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</code></pre>
        Follow the interactive prompts to create the key files. You'll have two files. One ending in .pub (the public key) and one
        not ending in .pub (the private key).
    </li><br>
    <li>
        You should have a file in ~/.ssh called authorized_keys.
        cat the public key file (file ending in .pub) onto the file authorized_keys:)
        <br>
        <code>cat your_key_name.pub >> authorized_keys</code>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Add the private key (file not ending in .pub) to secrets by going to Settings > Secrets > Actions in Github.<br>
        <img width=100% src="{{ url_for('static', filename='settings_secrets_actions.png') }}" alt="A guide to locating the Secrets option in Github."><br>
        When doing this, ensure that the parts that start with -----START OPENSSH KEY---- and ----END OPENSSH KEY----- are also copied.
    </li>
    <li>
        While you're adding secrets in that menu, you should also add one for your server's IP address.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then use a template .yml file for your Github Action.
    </li>
</ol>
